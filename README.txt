SOURCE CODE FOR THE ANTI-NFT BOT
CREATED BY: Idiot Creature Hater#2255 on Discord.

Anti-NFT bot is a open source discord.py bot that stops links to NFT websites, blocks phrases relating to NFT advertising, and
even NFT based discord servers.
Can also remove messages containing links to many NFT marketplaces.

This version also lets you set in your server if you want the bot to auto-ban members who sends NFT advertisements or not.

================================================

SETUP:
- Have discord.py installed. (use the requirements.txt file to install that)
- Go to https://discord.com/developers and create a discord bot application, create a bot, and copy its discord bot token if you have not already done so
- Fork or download this source code
- client.run("BOTTOKENHERE") where BOTTOKENHERE is your Discord Bot Token that you got from the Discord developer portal
- client = commands.Bot(command_prefix = "nft!") where nft! would be the prefix you want
- SETTING UP STAFF
>>>> Towards the bottom, head to botstaff = [757827467657478245]
>>>> In the botstaff brackets, replace 757827467657478245 with the discord user ids of your staff you want to control the bot.
>>>> To have more then one, seperate each user id with a comma and space. EXAMPLE: botstaff = [757827467657478245, 672273762892251136, 972161452133728256]
- Invite your bot to the server
>>>> When you invite the bot, the permissions needed is: Read Messages, Send Messages, Manage Messages, View Channel History, and Embed Links

With the json files, you don't need to touch them.

=================================================

EXTRA INFO

We are constantly updating the detection system to be able to stop Pro NFT Advertisements
like stopping NFT market websites and NFT project discord servers.

How it works is we have 2 blacklist.txt files so the bot can trigger different for each category.
blacklist.txt is for the bot to block NFT market websites.
blacklist2.txt is for the bot to block Pro NFT discord servers (like NFT project discord servers) and it responds differently.

With rewrites and major updates, they come with bugs, if you encounter a bug in the code, then open an issue.
