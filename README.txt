SOURCE CODE FOR THE ANTI-NFT BOT
CREATED BY: Idiot Creature Hater#2255 on Discord.

Anti-NFT bot is a open source discord.py bot that stops links to NFT websites, blocks phrases relating to NFT advertising, and
even NFT based discord servers.
Can also remove messages containing links to many NFT marketplaces.

================================================

SETUP:

- Have discord.py installed. ("pip install -r requirements.txt" in the terminal)
- Go to https://discord.com/developers and create a discord bot application, create a bot, and copy its discord bot token if you have not already done so
- Fork or download this source code
- client.run("BOTTOKENHERE") where BOTTOKENHERE is your Discord Bot Token that you got from the Discord developer portal
- client = commands.Bot(command_prefix = "nft!") where nft! would be the prefix you want
-- When you invite the bot, the permissions needed is: Read Messages, Send Messages, Manage Messages, View Channel History, and Embed Links

=================================================

EXTRA INFO:

We are constantly updating the detection system to be able to stop Pro NFT Advertisements
like stopping NFT market websites and NFT project discord servers.

How it works is we have 2 blacklist.txt files so the bot can trigger different for each category.
blacklist.txt is for the bot to block NFT market websites.
blacklist2.txt is for the bot to block Pro NFT discord servers (like NFT project discord servers) and it responds differently.

=================================================
