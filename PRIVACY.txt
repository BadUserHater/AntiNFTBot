ANTI-NFT Bot Privacy Policy
Last updated: October 4th, 2022

==WHAT DATA DO YOU COLLECT==
Anti-NFT Bot does not store any data by default, however if you use **nft!punishenable**, your server ID will be collected. If you decide to use the
nft!setlogchannel command, it will collect your server id AND channel id you have set the logs channel to be set where the logs should be sent too

==WHY IS THIS DATA NEEDED?==
This data is needed to operate the bot's settings. This includes:
- If a user should be punished if an NFT website is sent to your server
- Where the logs should be sent in your server

==HOW DO I REMOVE MY DATA?==
To remove the server ID it collected from the nft!punishenable command, then execute **nft!punishdisable**. If you kick the bot before doing this, then please reach out to the owner of the bot to remove your data.
To remove your server ID and channel ID from setting the logs channel, because the disable logs command does not work, you have to join our support server below, and talk to Idiot Creature Hater#2255
in the #support-and-suggestions forum channel with your server ID so we can start the data removal process. If you do NOT provide your server id to support, we can not help you.
